Class & Object

- Class is a blueprint that u can create object from
- object is a member in the main application
- class has properties
- variable inside class = property
- variable outside class = variable
- function inside class = method
- function outside class = function
- [class] = class keyword
- [new] = new object
- [public, private, protected]
- [->] = object operator
- [ $this ] = pseudo variable [ refer to object properties ]
- [ :: ] = scope resolution operator [ pammayim nekudotayim ] = double colon

Apple
- Class       = Apple blueprint Design
- Object      = iphone that China made
- Application = Apple store

Web Application Registeration
- class       = code to add new member
- object      = the member
- Application = web application registeration

Blog system
- class       = code to add new post,  article, news, information
- object      = post, article, news, information
- Apllication = blog system

$this vs self

-self:

- refer to current class
- access static members
- not use ( $ ) because its not represent variable but present class construction

-$this:
- refer to current object
- access non static varible
- use ($) vecause it represent a variable

 * class Abstraction
- can not be instantiated [ can not create object from ]
- made for other classes to inhert properites and methods from
- can have methods and properities
- can have abstracted method and non abstracted method
- abstract methods [ contains no body code ]
- rules to go on
- force devlopers to follow your methods
- Removing the Abstraction Class will not effect the child classes
